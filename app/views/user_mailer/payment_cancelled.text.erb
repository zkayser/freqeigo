Invoice Payment Failed

  Hello from Hikarigo, 
  
  Unfortunately your most recent invoice payment for <%= @amount %> was declined. 
    This could be due to a change in your card number or your card expiring, cancelation of your credit card, 
    or the bank not recognizing the payment and taking action to prevent it. 

    Please update your payment information as soon as possible by logging in here:
